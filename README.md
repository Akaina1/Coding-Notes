August 16, 2023 Update:

Added C# notes.  These are rough notes only and not formatted like my C++ Guide. I may update them later.

September 25, 2023 Update:

Added JavaScript Notes.  This was my first time going into a different type of language than I was used to.
Also trying to learn CSS and HTML at the same time was interesting. I might make some more detailed notes on
CSS and HTML in the future.
